C# v.s Net:
 - C# is a programming language
 - .NET is a framework, can run multiple languages

C# general:
C# is in the same family as C and C++. On both those languages, the compiler then writes that code into assembly language on that machine. 
C# compiles into intermediate code, which is not machine specific. CLR takes over to produce machine code. 
Long story short, a program made in C# will run on any machine that has CLR installed.
